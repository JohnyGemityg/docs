ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, [open-source](https://github.com/aspnet/home) framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications. With ASP.NET Core, you can:

* Build web apps and services, [IoT](https://www.microsoft.com/internet-of-things/) apps, and mobile backends.
* Use your favorite development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Deploy to the cloud or on-premises.
* Run on [.NET Core or .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/standard/choosing-core-framework-server).
