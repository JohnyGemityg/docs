# Introduction #

NETX Smart Router series were jointly developed with Brno University of Technology to provide high-performance and open-source
routing platform. NETX routers offer industry-standard routing and management protocols and support configuration through a command-line 
interface (CLI) or via API.

NETX routers use `netc`, a custom and higly flexible command line tool that allows to configure a Linux based system in the same way as 
network devices. Philosophy of `netc` operation is based on Cisco/Juniper or Mikrotik configuration styles.
