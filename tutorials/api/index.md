# API tutorials

NETX routers can be configured either via `netc` CLI shell or via REST API. REST API allows to integrate and automate
the whole configuration process of NETX router. The following tutorials show some ideas how to automate part of the configuration
via API. Please see [Contributig Guide](~/index.md#contributing-guide) if you have a tip for another tutorial or you would like to extend some of 
the current tutorials.

* [Blacklist for a temporary block of IP addresses](blacklist.md)
